        <h2>Hampi</h2>
        <p id="text1">
            Set in an awesome boulder-strewn landscape along the banks of the Tungabhadra River, Hampi was the capital
            city of the magnificent capital of the mighty Vijayanagara Empire. Founded by Harihara and Bukka in 1336, it
            fell to the Muslim rulers of the Deccan in 1565, and the city was pillaged over a period of six months
            before being abandoned. The once-proud city of victory is now a city of desolation. However, the ruins of
            these historical monuments have withstood the ravages of man and time, and still evoke memories of the
            grandeur of a bygone era.

        <p>Classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, this historic town is also the “World’s Largest Open-air
            Museum” and covers an area of nearly 29 sq km. Vijayanagara Empire at its peak was very prosperous and was
            believed to be larger than Rome with palaces grander than of Lisbon “The city is such that the pupil of the
            eye has never seen a place like it, and the ear of intelligence has never been informed that there existed
            anything to equal it in the world”, marvelled a 15th century Persian ambassador Abdul Razaak. There were
            opulent palaces, marvelous temples, massive fortifications, baths, markets, aquaducts, pavilions, stables
            for royal elephants, and elegantly carved pillars. This was a city whose merchants traded in diamonds,
            pearls, horses, fine silks and brocades.</p>

        <p>Most of the important structures and ruins are located in two areas, which are generally referred to as the
            Royal Centre and the Sacred Centre. The Royal Centre in the south-west part of the site contains structures
            that seem to have been palaces, baths, pavilions, royal stables and temples for ceremonial use. The Sacred
            Centre stretches around the Virupaksha Temple and the Hampi Bazaar area and is along the banks of the holy
            Tungabhadra River.

            The ruins of Hampi are extensive and fascinating enough to absorb your attention for several days.</p>
